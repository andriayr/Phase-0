- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

Translating the previous things we learned into the site felt intuitive. Because of this week's training, it was the necessary next step. I started by reviewing the directions and expectations. My partner and I then decided to create a basic wire frame. We divided the tasks, used time block and updated each other on our progress. It was smooth, and because we learned the proper process early on, it was easier to employ that strategy for this activity.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I used the HTML5 Doctor to help me identify the language to use footers, headers, etc. The website was easy to use and the directions were clear. I found researching simple for this particular exercise, but I think thats partly because the information for HTML is a little more straight to the point.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I think I did a decent job. I wanted to do more formatting, but since we will learn that next week in the CSS section of the program, I had to let go and respect the process. But I really wanted to beautify the site.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

I like the simplicity of HTML. I like how the codes are very straight forward and feel intuitive once you do it more frequently. I think the only bad thing about HTML is that you can write hours of code, and only create a skeleton of something. It can take a long time, and not much is created.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

So far I have just been creating index cards, and studying those to help me remember code.
