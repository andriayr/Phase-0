### Describe what open source means.
What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open source refers to computer program that is available to the general public for use and modification. Presently, I feel a bit nervous about it because I do not want the code that I am creating to be available at this time since I am still in the very early stages of my learning. Although, feedback can be very helpful.

#### Assess the importance of using licenses.

Based on what I read, copyright licenses are automatic in the United States. Depending on the license you use impacts how much access a person has to your code to view, change, or distribute.

##### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I have a practical understanding of git and github. I understand forking, cloning, git status, git log, git add, git commit -m, git checkout -b. But my current challenge is knowing how to delete a branch from git and not git hub. Also, I was having a difficult time merging my file at one point, but do not understand why I had that challenge, and after trying it for the 50th time, it finally worked. I was happy that it worked, but I would have loved the aha moment to realize what I had done wrong all those other times.
