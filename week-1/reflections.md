# 1.1 Think about time reflection

Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
After reviewing all of the resources, I was fascinated by many of them. I have always heard about the benefits of meditation, but never thought that I could actually attempt it because my mind was just too busy all of the time. But when I read that it helps with anxiety, and can help improve focus, it seemed like something worth trying. Ever since I knew I would start DBC I have been very nervous, to the point where I am struggling to sleep. I want to be good so badly, that my mind has created a level of unnecessary anxiety. I am hoping that if I try to use meditation I may distract myself, but will also help me stay focused and productive. I also liked the idea of the Pomodoro method… executing tasks in short burst, and then giving your mind an opportunity to rest seems like a sound strategy. I think if I couple the Pomodoro method with meditation, I will be able to accomplish more tasks in a concise and efficient way, without burning myself out, and while also taking steps of self care to rejuvenate myself, even for only 5 minutes.

What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
Time Boxing refers to the idea that a person or team works on a project/task for a predetermined set of time, and once that time is up, they stop and asses the progress they made. The Time Boxing Method reminds me of the Pomodoro method, because the Pomodoro Method operates similarly-work for a period of time (this time should include a review), stop, break. I think I could use this method during phase one, by giving myself an amount of time for which I will work, and then review how much progress I made. I will then walk away from the work for a period of time, and then will start over again. Similar to the Pomodoro method, I think this can prevent burn out, and is beneficial because it will allow you to return to your work with a fresh set of eyes. This can be really helpful, especially when you are encountering roadblocks.

How do you manage your time currently?
I think I do a good job of managing my time, but I know I work too much and do not give myself enough breaks. I usually cause myself to burn out, and that burn out impacts my mood and my confidence. In this process I really want to do thing differently. I want to work more effectively and efficiently, which means that I will focus on the work, but will not neglect my personal wellbeing. I will make sure to take more breaks, be more aware of how I'm feeling (tired, hungry, thirsty, anxious, etc), and use my break to reconcile that feeling.



Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
Yes and No, it works, because the work always gets done. No, because I am usually defeated afterwards. So incorporating time blocks, and meditation will be a much more impactful way for me to manage my time and my well being. I am fully aware of my habit of neglecting myself for a task, but I believe that during this learning process that will be destructive, so I plan to take a very proactive approach to ensure that I am able to break this cycle, and adopt healthier strategies in its place.



 Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
I would like to employ the time blocks, meditation, and tiny habits. I am going to do that by incorporating the new habits after my existing habits. I will do my best to take it a day at a time, and if I loose track, I will write down all the things I accomplished for that day, and work to accomplish more the next day. I will not dwell on the things I couldn’t do, but rather I will focus on ways to grow and get better. I will create a schedule, utilize a timer, and do my very best to walk away when it is time to take a break. Ultimately, my discipline and consistency will make the biggest impact, and by the time these 9 weeks are complete, I hope to have created some strong time management and productivity habits.



 What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
I’ve created a schedule for myself for Phase 0. In this schedule, I have incorporated time to work, relax, eat, exercise, and rest. After watching the clip of creating habits, I realized that the items on my calendar are built upon my existing habits. My schedule also uses the time block method, and after todays activity will begin to include meditation. My plan is as follows:
* Wake up, drink water (tiny habit), make coffee/shake, exercise(tiny habit), eat breakfast, shower, and then work (work for 1 hour, rest for 10 minutes, do this for 3 hours), eat lunch, walk/meditate (tiny habit), work (another 3 hours), spend time with my partner, eat dinner, read/work on job related items (1.5 minutes), guided meditation(tiny habit),sleep.
# 1.2 The command line reflection

1 What is a shell? A shell is a program that takes your command and gives them to the operating system to perform.
What is “bash?" Bash is a file that processes commands that can be run in the terminal.
2 What was the most challenging for you in going through this material? PUSHD and POPD; I don't seem to understand the difference between these commands, and/or the purpose. At one point when I was trying to cp a txt file into an existing directory, I had a challenging time, but I was able to identify my error. The problem was I was not correcting writing the path of the existing directory. Once I figured out the issue, I was able to correct it and attempt it multiple times without errors.
3 Were you able to successfully use all of the commands? Yes, I was able to successfully use all of the commands.
4 In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know? Based on the what I have accomplished so far, the most important commands were the ones I used most frequently are pwd, ls, mv, cd ../, touch, mkdir, rm, rmdir, man
5 Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does. Yes, the following commands do:
-pwd- PRINT WORKING DIRECTORY
-ls- LIST DIRECTORIES
-mv - MOVE FILES AND DIRECTORIES
-cd - CHANGE INTO OTHER DIRECTORIES
-../ -MOVE BACK TO PREVIOUS DIRECTORY
-touch- CREATE NEW FILE
-mkdir- CREATE NEW DIRECTORY
-less- ALLOWS YOU TO PAGE THROUGH A FILE
-rmdir - REMOVE DIRECTORY
-rm- REMOVE FILE
-help- PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE ONLINE COMMANDS

# 1.4 Forking and cloing reflection

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be?
How to Create A New Repo:
Log into your github account
Click on the “+” located next to your avatar
Create a repository name
Select your privacy setting (public- anyone can see this repository or private-you choose who can see and commit the repository)
Add an MIT license
Click “Create repository”

How to Fork a Repo- If you want to copy an interesting repository to your profile, do the following:
Select the repository you would like to fork
Click the fork button
Select the location the repository should be forked to
After the repository has been forked, you will be directed to your copy of the repository, you will know that it has been copied because your username will be in front of the repository name.

How to Clone a Repo:
After forking a repository, the repository exits only in your Github account, in order to make edits to your file, it must exist on your computer
Open your terminal, and identify the path you want to place the repository, and cd to that directory.
Copy the URL of your forked repository
In your terminal write git clone followed by the URL, it should look like this:
git clone URL_THAT YOU COPIED
Once it has been copied, your terminal will prompt that the copy has been completed.
Then execute the ls command to ensure that the copy has been added to your directory
Then open it in sublime



Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
I would fork a repository if I have identified an interesting repository that I would like add to my profile. I would create a new repository if I am interested in creating something new.

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
So far I did not have any challenges setting up git and GitHub. Initially when I was watching the git tutorials I understood how to follow the instructions, but couldn't conceptualize how it worked until going through this particular lesson. Accessing the command line to control the git was very helpful. I feel like I understand the important key terms used in git and github so I have a clearer understanding of what it does and how it works.
