 <h1>Version Control</h1>

 <p>A version control system (VCS) allows you to track the history of a collection of files and supports creating versions of this collection.  Each version captures a snapshot of the files at a certain point and the VCS allows you to switch between these versions.  Additonally, version control makes edits to files accessible via branching and merging any edits. Also, if you should accidently delete a file, version control has an automatic backup feature. Another benefit of version control is the ability for multiple people to collaboratively edit text files.</p>

<h1>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h1>


    <p>
        So far in my learning process there are a few key commands that have helped me understand how git helps me track files. To begin, the following commands should be embedded in your memory: </p>
        <p>
        1. Make a new file: touch newfile.txt </p>

        <p> 2. Add it: git add newfile.txt </p>

        <p> 3. Make an initial commit: git commit -m "Initial commit" </p>

        <p> 4. See what you have done: git log </p>

        <p> 5. Check to see what has changed: git diff </p>

        <p> Its a good idea to commit early, and commit often. Commit is the equivalent of "save". If your commits are small, it will become much easier to go back and review what you have done, and allow you to undo the damage you may have caused.  So to answer the question, how does git help you track changes, is by letting you commit early and often, and by letting you track all of the changes you made to you program.

    <!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
-I am required to use the following tags DOCTYPE, html, head, title, and body. These are the fundamental codes needed to ensure functionality of the html file. I find that I often use the h tags (1-6) and p tags to add structure to the body of the of html file.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements? The tags I mentioned above build the foundation of the html, once that is established, the following tags are added to build the blueprint of the webpage. Those tags give your code purpose and contribute to the overall layout of your page.
<header>
<footer>
<section>
<article>
<aside>
<nav>

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

Learning about the snippets was awesome. I am sure once I begin building my skills in html/css/ruby/java etc, that I will be able to create these useful shortcuts to make my coding process much easier.
