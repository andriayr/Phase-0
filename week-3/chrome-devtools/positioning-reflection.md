How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

By using Chrome's DevTools it allows you to modify and debug. It provides developers the ability to identify layout issues, and test out possible edits that you can use for your site. I used Devtools when working on assignment 3.3 and 3.4 and it helped me identify issues with my classes and how they were nested. I could directly see how specificity impacted the execution of code, and made it easy to test out code without making modifications to my html file.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
Using the resize property in CSS will allow you to resize elements in the DOM.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

-Static is the default positioning for every page element.This means that the elements on the page will flow onto the page as it normally would
-Relative means that the position is relative to itself. From what I am reading, and think I understand about relative is that if you set a position to relative with no other attributes it will be exactly the same as if you left it static. But if you begin adding attributes then it will begin to shift its position as told by the attribute to where it would normally be.
-Absolute position allows you to place any page element exactly where you want it to go. This is where the top,left, bottom, right attributes. T
-Fixed positioning is position relative to the browser window, so a fixed position element will stay right where it is when you begin scrolling.


What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
-Padding goes around all four sides of the content.
-Borders go outside the padding
-Margins are directly outside of the borders.


What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?) I really did not enjoy this exercise. I felt as though I was guessing rather than making adjustments based on my understanding. I am starting to get a little more comfortable with the concepts of positioning, but I do not feel as though I have a good command of it. I could clearly see my weakness with this aspect of css from this challenge. I don't exactly feel as though I learned a great deal. But instead, this assignment confirmed my limited understanding of the exercise.
